<h2>Walk Through:</h2>

<p> Download and install VMware workstation: https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html </p>
<p> Download and install Nessus Essential: https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials </p>
<p> Download Windows 10 ISO: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 </p>

<p> Sidenote you can use another virtualization software if you want bestides VMware such as oraclebox</p>

<p>For nessus Make sure to save the URL that opens in your browser after install. It can be a pain if you lose it so dont :) I just saved it in a notpad in the installation folder. Connect Via SSL, go to advanced and proceed anyway. Nessus will take a min installing and initialzing everything. Register for Nesus Essentials using the code sent by them in the Eamil. You shouldnt need to re enter information thus you can skip bc you already have a code. Setup an account you can remember and dont forget it!</p>

<p> Setup your VM with the 2010 ISO. Make sure to use a Bridged network connection in Network settings after Creation so it functions on the same connections normally for ease of use for Nessus. Install windows 10 and choose no Product Key for windows 10 Pro as your install option.</p>
