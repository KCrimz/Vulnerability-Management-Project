<h1>Vulnerability Nessus Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
We are going to install Nessus and VMWARE to create an enviorment on a windows 10 Virtual machine to Create opportunities for Vulnerability testing. Using some older software and running vulnerability scans 
against them. Then we will remediate a couple of issues found to show capability of base vulnerability management!

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Nessus essentials</b> 
- <b>VMWare Workstation player</b>

<h2>Environments Used</h2>

- <b>Windows 10 VM</b>

<h2>Skills:</h2>  

- <b>Install and configure VM with windows 10 ISO to run vulnerability scans</b>
- <b>Implememnted scan With nessus in a sandbox network based enviornment utilizing Discover, Prioritize, Asses , Report, Remediate, and Verify</b>
- <b>Developed automated Remediation responses and processes to preemptively lessen Vulnerabilities</b>

<h2>Walk Through:</h2>

<p> Download and install VMware workstation: https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html </p>
<p> Download and install Nessus Essential: https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials </p>
<p> Download Windows 10 ISO: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 </p>

<p> Sidenote you can use another virtualization software if you want bestides VMware such as oraclebox</p>

<p>For nessus Make sure to save the URL that opens in your browser after install. It can be a pain if you lose it so dont :) I just saved it in a notpad in the installation folder. Connect Via SSL, go to advanced and proceed anyway. Nessus will take a min installing and initialzing everything. Register for Nesus Essentials using the code sent by them in the Eamil. You shouldnt need to re enter information thus you can skip bc you already have a code. Setup an account you can remember and dont forget it!</p>

<p> Setup your VM with the 2010 ISO. Make sure to use a Bridged network connection in Network settings after Creation so it functions on the same connections normally for ease of use for Nessus. Install windows 10 and choose no Product Key for windows 10 Pro as your install option.</p>

<p> Setup an offline windows account to whatever you like. Have the sliders on "no" when setting up options for privacy and now we have the base of everything setup for the lab. DIsable windows firewall (advanced settings) windows defender  turn off
domain, profile, and public firewalla states off. MAKE SURE THIS IS YOUR VM not your PERSONAL Device! Ping your VM IP from your Device to make sure it can be reached</p>

<p> Next make sure to Get your IP address from your VM by using CMD(coommand prompt) with ipconfig. We are going to use that for setting up the nessus scan next. Go into the nessus local host on your browser and create a new basic network scan. Name it for the project and use the VM IP address in the Targets box. We are going to do a mainly scan for this porject but there are other settings to setup a scheduler and certain parameters for the scan should you need them. ESPECIALLY in the credentials Tab! Save scan and luanch it to begin. Click to see progress of it doing its thing</p>

<p>Now go to "services" in your VM for windows 10 and we are going to enable Remote registry so nessus can have access to credential scannings. Set remote registry to automatic, apply, then start the process! You can close Services. GO to advanced sharing settings and have File and printer sharing on if they arent already.</p>

<p>Now we NEVER do this in a real world enviornemnt to prefice but for this lab go to user account controls and bring the slider all the way down in your windows 10 VM. Now we have to go into the registry and add a value to allow a remote account to scan into the VM. THe doumentation for this can be found here directly from Nessus https://community.tenable.com/s/article/Scanning-with-non-default-Windows-Administrator-Account?language=en_US . In Registry go to local_machine,Software,microsoft,windows,currentversion,policies,system where we are going to make a new DWORD 32 bit called "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" and set value to 1. Restart virtual machine</p>
